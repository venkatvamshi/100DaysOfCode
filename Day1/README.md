# Question 1. Union of arrays

# Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.
# Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their sorted union.

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
# m = 3, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3}
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5
# Explanation: Distinct elements including 
# both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.
